The scripts in this folder were written throughout 2014, with no aims to be computationally efficient. Checks for a single change-point in a time-series, comparing between different possible models (noise, linear trend, change-point in the mean, change-point in the linear trend).

In 2016 the [R package "changepoint"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/changepoint/index.html) by Killick et al. was released, which covers these and many other related topics.

I would highly recommend using their code over mine, as it is properly reviewed and much more efficient.
