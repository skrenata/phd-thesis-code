The scripts in this folder were written throughout 2014, with no aims to be computationally efficient. Checks for a single change-point in a time-series, comparing between different possible models (noise, linear trend, change-point in the mean, change-point in the linear trend).

In 2016 an R package that covers these and many other topics was released: [https://github.com/rkillick/changepoint](https://github.com/rkillick/changepoint)

I would highly recommend using their code over mine, as it is properly reviewed and much more efficient.
